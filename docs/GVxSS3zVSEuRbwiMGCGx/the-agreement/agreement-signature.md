# Agreement signature

The agreement will be digital and generated online with the data the operator enters on the dedicated portal, and signed with a digital signature by the operator's legal representative or other person who is authorized to sign on behalf of the operator.

The operator must therefore have a digital signature certificate that is valid at the moment of enrollment and issued by an body included in the public list of certifiers from the [Agency for Digital Italy](http://www.agid.gov.it/) (AgID), and generated by means of a device that creates a secure signature, pursuant to art. 38(2) of Italian Presidential Decree 445/2000 and art. 65 of Italian Leg. Decree 82/2005. 

The digital signature required for the agreement must be in **PAdES format**. This method makes it possible to generate a file signed digitally with the **.pdf extension** and is the only format managed by the portal dedicated to operators.
