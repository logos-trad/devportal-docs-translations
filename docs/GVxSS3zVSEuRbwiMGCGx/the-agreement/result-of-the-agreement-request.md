**Negative assessment:** if at the end of the assessments as specified in the previous paragraph the Department does not believe that the request for an agreement is suitable for the spirit and purpose of the Program or, in any case, does not fulfill the necessary criteria and requirements, it will reject the registration request. 

The operator will receive a communication informing of the reasons the request was rejected or, if appropriate, what should be changed or how to correct the data already entered.

**Positive assessment**: if the agreement request is approved the Department will communicate this to the operator by sending an email with the approval.
