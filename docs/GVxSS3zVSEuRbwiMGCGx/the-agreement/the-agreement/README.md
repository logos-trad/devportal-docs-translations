## Access to the portal 

Signing an agreement between the operator and the Department defines the operator's willingness to join the program and sets out the terms and conditions of registration for the Operator.

The agreement process with an operator starts when the representative accesses the portal for the first time. They will be guided step by step in compiling the necessary data and, when the request is completed, it will be sent via the portal to the Department for review and resulting approval/non-approval. 

## Acknowledgment of the documentation

As soon as the operator accesses the portal, they must acknowledge the [**privacy policy** ](https://io.italia.it/carta-giovani-nazionale/informativa-operatori)and the **technical documentation** related to the initiative, clicking on the provided links. 

## Operator data

Subsequently, the operator must enter the following data:

* Operator company data;
* Data and contacts of the appointed representative;
* Description of the operator;
* Definition of the method of recognition of the opportunities.

[**See the details regarding the data required from the operator ‚Üí** ](operator-data-details.md)

In the agreement, the operator is requested to identify a physical person assigned to be the **Representative**, understood as the agent and technical and administrative delegate who takes on an operative role for managing the operator's profile (and the related opportunities) on the dedicated portal, and who is authorized to act in the name of and on behalf of the operator for all fulfillments related to the program.

The representative who requests authorization to access the portal must have a personal SPID and must be the person indicated in the Agreement. The representative can be the legal representative of the operator or be a delegate. The representative can access (and therefore manage the operator profile) with their personal SPID credentials.

The assigned representative can indicate a maximum of **4 other representatives** who are authorized to access the portal on behalf of the operator.

{% hint style="info" %} Since October 2022, operators are required to enter the marked texts üá¨üáß also in English. This makes it possible for the users of the IO app to correctly use the content if they expressed their app language preference as English and also makes it faster to upload the offer to the EYCA circuit, if applicable. {% endhint %}

The operators who work online and want to join the program via their web/e-commerce platforms must declare in this phase the specific [method for recognizing the ](../../the-opportunities/le-modalita-di-riconoscimento-e-validazione-delthe-opportunities/)[opportunities](../../the-opportunities/le-modalita-di-riconoscimento-e-validazione-delthe-opportunities/) from among those available.

{% hint style="warning" %} The selected methods of recognition cannot be changed after sending the agreement. {% endhint %}

## Information concerning the opportunities

**Private operators** will be requested to provide [information regarding the opportunities](../../the-opportunities/how-to-create-an-opportunity/opportunity-data-details.md) the operator wants to offer in order for the Department to perform a proper assessment. 

**Public operators (public administration)** are not required to present this information: they can add a new opportunity only when the agreement request has been approved. 

## The documents

Once the required data has been compiled, the operator must: 

1. Download the agreement documents that have been compiled automatically with the data entered previously; 
2. Have it signed with a digital signature by the legal representative, in compliance with the requirements indicated in the [following section](../agreement-signature.md);
3. Upload them to the portal in the relative section once properly signed. Documents in a format different than the original electronic document produced by the portal will not be accepted (e.g. Digital scans, photographs, even if hand-written documents). 
4. Once the digitally signed documentation has been uploaded correctly, the agreement request can be sent to the Department by pressing the ‚ÄúRequest approval‚Äù button, which will assess it based on the criteria set for the public notice. If considered suitable, the Department will approve the request and will complete the agreement by countersigning it and uploading the documents. 
5. The operator will receive a communication confirming the approval of the agreement, which will be sent to the email the representative provided when uploading the data. 
6. From that moment, the operator must comply with the methods described in this documentation for the identification of the beneficiaries and for the acknowledgment of the opportunities, implementing any technical fulfillments as necessary for which they are responsible related to the selected method. Then they must publish the relative opportunities by pressing the ‚ÄúPublish‚Äù button, making them visible and usable by the beneficiaries in the IO app. 

Every registered operator will be responsible for the opportunities and the relative descriptions and information, as published in App, for the checks and correct operation of the analogue and/or technological processes (e.g. check of the availability of the opportunities on the indicated dates, correctness of the supplied links, etc.) necessary for using the opportunities offered to the beneficiaries.

{% hint style="warning" %} Even if the operator is affiliated, they will not appear on the list of operators included in the CGN section of the IO app until they have at least one active and published opportunity.

It remains understood that if the operator does not have active opportunities for an extended period of time will lead to the Department performing an assessment for the purposes of ending the agreement. {% endhint %}
