## Conditions <a href="#condizioni" id="condizioni"></a>

Do the conditions need to provide details about possible limitations to access the service? Is it a one-time offer? Can it be applied to the entire product catalog? Can it be used multiple times?

#### **Editorial rules:**

:white_check_mark: **DO'S**

* Indicate the conditions of the opportunity in a clear and concise manner;
* Write short phrases;
* If the opportunity requires a presale and therefore is published before the connected item can be used, specify this in the conditions;
* Indicate that the opportunity will be valid as long as codes are available.

:x:**DONT'S**

* Not providing a link;
* If you are an online operator, do not enter the discount code here: enter it in the related field, even if it is univocal and does not change from user to user;
* If presale is not required, it is not necessary to specific the dates of validity here: they will be displayed in the corresponding fields.
