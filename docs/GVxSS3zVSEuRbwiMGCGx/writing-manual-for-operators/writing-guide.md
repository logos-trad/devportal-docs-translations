# Guide to writing

This brief guide defines some editorial rules for writing texts for the National Youth Card opportunities.

The purpose of the rules is to:

* Make the texts of the opportunities mutually coherent;
* Keep the content coherent with the tone of voice of the IO app;
* Make it easier for users to understand.

## In general:

:point_right: Always address the user directly, with “you”, avoiding expressions such as “customer”, “holder of the CGN card”;

:point_right: Use a colloquial and clear tone;

:point_right: Do not mention the National Youth Card, the user who is reading these texts is already in the section dedicated to the initiative;

:point_right: Do not write entire phrases in uppercase.
