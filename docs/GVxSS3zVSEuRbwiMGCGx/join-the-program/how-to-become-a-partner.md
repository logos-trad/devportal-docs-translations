The registration flow has three phases: 

1. Publishing a notice
2. Sending the expression of interest 
3. Identification of the operator by the Department 

***

## Publishing a notice 

The Department publishes a notice on its institutional website, informing the interested operators of the possibility to register for the Program by expressing interest. 

The public notice contains information about the terms and condition of registration.

## Sending the expression of interest

The operator completes the expression of interest and sends it to the Department, communicating the following data:

* Company name of the operator; 
* FC/VAT no. of the operator; 
* First name, last name and fiscal code of the representative delegated to perform the operational activities related to the program on behalf of the operator (“**Representative**”). 

## Operator identification

The Department will collect the expressions of interest and will select the operators considered in possession of the requirements and who are evaluated as suitable, inviting them to participate in the procedure for registering for the Program, then providing the relative representative with access to the online portal dedicated to the operators (“**Portal**”).

The representative can do the following on the portal:

* present the opportunities to the Operator;
* Complete and upload the signed agreement documents;
* Once the agreement is completed, directly manage, integrate or improve the opportunities they intend to offer to the Beneficiaries.
