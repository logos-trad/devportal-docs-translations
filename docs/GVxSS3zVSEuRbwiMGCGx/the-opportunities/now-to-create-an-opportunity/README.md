# How to create an opportunity

Private operators must create at least one opportunity during the agreement phase on the portal.  When the agreement request is approved by the Department, they can create others, always by accessing the portal. 

Public operators can create an opportunity only when the agreement process is concluded and the agreement has been activated, always accessing the portal. 

An operator can create an infinite number of opportunity drafts in their personal area, but can publish a **maximum of 5 at a time** on the IO app. 

{% hint style="warning" %} No changes are admitted, not even small ones (for example, placing distinctive marks such as asterisks or similar) or ones that are merely descriptive for opportunities already active on the CGN. {% endhint %}

## Information concerning the opportunities

To create an opportunity, the operator must enter some information to describe the initiative they want to propose to the beneficiaries. 

[**See the details of the data required to create an opportunity →** ](opportunity-data-details.md)

## Duration of the opportunities

The opportunities must last at least 24 hours (to be used exclusively for events or flash offers) and are displayed in App only within the time limits defined by the duration set by the operator.

Once the limit of the duration has been exceeded, the opportunity will be still be visible on the portal with the “expired” status, but no longer in the CGN section of the IO app. 

## "New" badge

When a new opportunity is published on the IO app, it is signaled to the beneficiaries by means of a badge.

The badge offers the possibility to the operator to be displayed at the top of the list of operators participating in the program for 15 days from the start date of the opportunity or the date on which it is visible in the IO app. 

The badge will be visible in the Operator list and in the opportunity categories and will display the number of new opportunities the operator published. Furthermore the badge will also be placed on the opportunity visible on the page with the operator's details.  
  
After the 15 days, the operator will be inserted in the list in alphabetical order A­- Z.

## Terms and conditions for accessing the opportunities

During the agreement phase, or afterwards when inserting on the Portal new proposals for opportunities or integration with those already published, the operator is free to determine with their representative, within the terms indicated below, the conditions applicable to the opportunities offered to the beneficiaries, also using the criteria based on the category of the product/service or the different age ranges of the beneficiaries. 

It remains understood that the operator is responsible for providing the necessary information and for making the beneficiaries aware of the applicable terms and conditions of the opportunities by correctly compiling and keeping updated the documentation presented when registering and the relative opportunities visible on the IO app. The operator is responsible for the information and descriptions of the opportunities they publish on the CGN.

## Recognition and validation of the opportunities

The operator is also required - at their expense - to have the instruments available (including the technical developments) necessary for the recognition of the opportunities to the beneficiaries based on the various conditions applied, and proceed with the suitable verifications regarding if the beneficiary has the requirements necessary for making use of the opportunities in compliance with the applicable terms and conditions, refraining from determining conditions that are obviously discriminatory and/or that promote fraudulent behaviors by the beneficiaries, holding harmless the Department and PagoPA S.p.A. against claims or disputes from beneficiaries or third parties.

When performing their control functions, the Department can monitor and check the effective and regular recognition of the opportunities in the terms published on the IO app.
