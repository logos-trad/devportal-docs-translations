# Recognition of the opportunities to holders of EYCA

The CGN belongs to the [EYCA](https://www.eyca.org/) circuit (European Youth Cards Association) which allows young Europeans between the ages of 18 and 30, who possess a card that is part of the circuit, to access discounts from participating operators in their own country or other European countries.  
The operators registered with the program are therefore required to extend their opportunities offered for the CGN - in English - also to European youth holding the EYCA card according to the methods indicated below.

## **Operators operating via physical locations**

For operators registered with the program who recognize the opportunities at their physical stores, counters or ticket offices, the validation model described on the page [Physical presence of the CGN beneficiary](le-modalita-di-riconoscimento-e-validazione-delthe-opportunities/physical-presence-of-the-beneficiary.md) remains unchanged, which takes place via the recognition of the EYCA logo shown on the card presented by the concerned young beneficiary: the operators participating in the CGN program must instruct their personnel who are in physical contact with the customers to recognize the EYCA cards of the other European countries.

## **Operators who operate online**

Operators who are registered with the program are required to recognize the same opportunities also for holders of the EYCA card. 

Those who operate online and use the _static code_ model, the _list of static codes_ model of the _landing page_ enable the recognition of the opportunity within the EYCA circuit, and in that case the opportunity will also be published on the [EYCA portal](https://www.eyca.org/discounts) (in English)

### Focus on the code list (bucket)

Operators who selected the _list of_  _static codes_ mode must provide the Department with a new list of codes for each opportunity extended to holders of the EYCA card, completed following the attached template:

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/bucket_EYCA_format.xls" %}   Template for uploading the static code list to the EYCA website {% endfile %}

The list, with at least 10,000 codes must be **different than the one created and uploaded to the Operator Portal for the National Youth Card** and must be sent to the following email address: [cartagiovaninazionale@governo.it](mailto:cartagiovaninazionale@governo.it). 

The lists corresponding to the single opportunities will then be uploaded to the [EYCA portal](https://www.eyca.org/discounts).

### Focus on the landing page

Operators who selected the _landing page_ mode must enter a URL in the portal dedicated to the opportunity and specific to the EYCA portal. On the EYCA portal, it is **not** possible to enter the _Referer_ to guarantee access to the web page where the purchase is performed.

{% hint style="info" %} For correct use by EYCA beneficiaries, it is recommended to implement a dedicated web page in English.   {% endhint %}

### Online methods that are incompatible with EYCA

Also the operators who selected methods that are not compatible with the EYCA circuit can express their interest in joining the EYCA circuit via the create/modify opportunity page.

If they show interest to use the same _online_ method also for the EYCA circuit, the operator will be contacted by the Department to define together a possible method of recognition provided by EYCA and limited to this perimeter.
