# The methods for recognizing and validating opportunities

This chapter describes the methods the operators must follow, when implementing the agreement for the identification of the beneficiaries and the recognition of the opportunities published in the CGN section of the IO app for the following use scenarios. 

The recognition method is associated with the operator's profile and is the same for all the opportunities the operator wants to offer to the beneficiaries.

The beneficiary accesses the opportunities:

* By going [physically ](physical-presence-of-the-beneficiary.md)to the sales location or other physical location indicated by the operator;
* Validating a discount code:
  * obtained [via API](api-mode.md);
  * obtained from a [static code;](static-discount-code-mode.md)
  * obtained via a [list of static codes](static-code-list-mode.md);
* accessing a [dedicated web page exposed by the operator](landing-page-mode.md)

{% hint style="info" %} Within the scope of the provided recognition methods, the use of the web pages dedicated to the CGN offers implies in any case the preparation of methods with which it is clearly indicated that the opportunity refers to the CGN program (first of all, by using the relative logo, see the section dedicated to the brands) and the content of the opportunities are carefully prepared in terms of their message so that they are consistent with the nature and spirit of the Program. {% endhint %}

### What happens if the operator changes the method of recognition and validation?

If the operator decides to change the method of recognition and validation of the opportunities, the status of all the relative opportunities that are published will switch to “suspended".

If the operator wants to publish their opportunities again, they must adapt them to the new selected method of recognition.

For example, if the operator decides to switch from the "_landing page_" method to the "_static code_” method, they must prepare and indicate a static code for each of the opportunities they want to publish again.
