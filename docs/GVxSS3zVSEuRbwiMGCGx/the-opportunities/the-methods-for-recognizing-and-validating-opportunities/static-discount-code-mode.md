# 3️⃣ Static discount code mode

If the operator has decided to register for the program through its own web and/or e-commerce site and with the static code mode, they must communicate a static discount code, which is freely determined directly by the operator, when defining the relative opportunity on the portal.

{% hint style="info" %} The code is alphanumerical and may not exceed 20 characters. {% endhint %}

The static code must be accepted by the operator on its systems for the entire duration of the opportunity offered to the beneficiaries. The experience takes place as follows: 

* The beneficiary accesses their CGN on the IO app and selects the operator of interest in the displayed list of operators; 
* The beneficiary can navigate through the opportunities offered by the operator and view the static code dedicated to the opportunity, with the possibility to copy it directly from the App to paste it in the operator's system; 
* The beneficiary goes to the operator's e-commerce website and, during checkout, enters the code previously viewed into the field provided for the application of discounts and opportunities before completing the purchase; 
* If there were no errors when entering the code and it is still valid, the opportunity will be applied to the cart.

{% hint style="warning" %} Different opportunities can be associated with different static codes for greater security. {% endhint %}
