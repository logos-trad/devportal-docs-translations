# 1️⃣ Physical presence of the beneficiary

In the case of purchases made in physical locations (stores, counters, ticket offices, etc.), the protocol for recognition requires the beneficiary to show the operator that they have the CGN, showing the virtual card in the Wallet section of the IO app. The screen of the app will show the digital version of the card that contains the following information:

* First and last name of the beneficiary; 
* Fiscal code of the beneficiary; 
* Status and date of activation of the CGN; 
* Expiration date of the CGN.

The graphic forms shown on the background of the virtual CGN card will be animated to guarantee to the operator's sales personnel the authenticity of the card and the information of the entitled person.  
The operator also has the right to request a valid identification document (ID card, driver's license, passport) that verifies the identity of the beneficiary.

{% hint style="warning" %} Unlike what takes place for the EYCA card, the CGN on the IO app **does not have univocal identification** and **a physical card** is **currently not issued**.   {% endhint %}
