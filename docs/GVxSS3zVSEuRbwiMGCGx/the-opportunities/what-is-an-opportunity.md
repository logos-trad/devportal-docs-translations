# What is an opportunity

{% hint style="info" %} Opportunities are specific functional technical and/or economical benefits offered by the operator to the beneficiaries that are exclusive to the CGN program or in any case more advantageous to those usually provided to the public or on the market directly by the operator {% endhint %}

The operator who joins the initiative following an agreement - as well as during the agreement relationship - must create and recognize one or more opportunities proposed and dedicated to the beneficiaries. 

The opportunities defined by the operator will be published in the [specific section of the IO app](../io-app/la-carta-giovani-nazionale-nelio-app.md), after passing technical tests using the dedicated portal.

The recognition to the beneficiaries of the opportunities assumes possession of the CGN as well as the use of the IO app by the beneficiaries, and can take place in different ways depending on if the operator operates in physical sales locations and/or online. 

The recognition method is univocal for the operator. Every registered operator is responsible for the necessary implementations in its systems, for the checks and correct operation of the analog and/or technological processes (e.g. check of the availability of the opportunities on the indicated dates, correctness of the supplied links, etc.) necessary for implementing the agreement, based on the opportunity recognition method selected during the agreement phase.

## Physical channel

All operators registered with the program who want to offer valid opportunities at **physical sales locations** must train their personnel at the cash registers or counters so they can recognize a CGN when it is presented by the holder **exhibiting their mobile device showing the animated CGN screen**  present in the IO app and apply the discount or relative opportunity to the amount of purchase. 

The operator can also request a valid **identification document** that verifies the identity of the beneficiary.

## Online channel

To join the program via an **online channel (e-commerce and/or web page)** the following alternative models are available for selection by the operator for the recognition of the opportunity in favor of the beneficiaries:

### API model

The model generates a temporary code (OTP) for the beneficiary via the IO APP, which must be validated by means of integration of the operator's e-commerce systems with the API system exposed by the IO platform. The operator must therefore have and/or acquire the technical knowledge necessary to make these changes to their own systems.

### Static discount code model

With this model, the operator communicates a static discount code when creating the opportunity that is accepted by its systems for the entire duration of the opportunity.

### Static code list model

The model, also called the _code bucket_, is similar to the previous model, but instead of a single static code, it has a list (bucket) of at least 10,000 (ten thousand) static codes that, once displayed by the beneficiary in App, are “consumed” by the systems.

### Landing page model

The model requires the operator to provide a URL and a _referer_, which direct to a web page provided by the operator specifically for the use of the offered opportunities.
