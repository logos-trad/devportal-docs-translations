# Statuses of the opportunities

The opportunities uploaded by the operators via the portal must have the following statuses: 

* draft
* being tested
* test passed
* test failed
* published
* suspended
* expired.

The status is visible from the opportunity section of the Portal, in the table summarizing the uploaded opportunities.

## Draft

The **draft** status refers to the compiled opportunities that were not yet published by the operator, and therefore not yet visible on the IO app. For example, the opportunities proposed by the operator during the agreement phase will be initially displayed on the Portal with a draft status so the operators can complete the technical interventions necessary for recognizing them (e.g. training of cashiers, API integration, etc.).

## Being tested

The opportunities of the online operators will have the **being tested** status when the operator requests the Department to verify that it functions, before proceeding with publication. **The test is mandatory**, which translates into an attempt to make a purchase according to the method of recognizing the opportunity selected by the operator, which takes place:

* Autonomously, by the technical representatives of the Department for static codes, code list and landing page; 
* In collaboration with the operator for the API mode.

{% hint style="info" %} To permit the execution of the test, if static codes or a code list is used, before sending the opportunity for testing, the operator must make the relative codes active and usable.  {% endhint %}

## Test result

The test result can be positive or negative. When the result is registered on the portal, the opportunities switch to the status:

* **Test passed**, if the result of the test was positive. From this moment, the operator can publish the opportunity at any moment, entering the opportunity tab, opening the opportunity in question and clicking â€œPublish";
* **Test failed**, if the result of the test was negative. The Department will communicate the reason and the operator can make the suitable changes (on the portal or on their own systems) and request a new test.

## Published

The **published** status identifies the opportunities that are visible in the IO app and that are valid. The first time an operator (who operates online) publishes an opportunity, an alert is displayed, which requests confirmation that the necessary technical procedures were actually completed. The opportunity will be **visible on the IO app** and available to the beneficiaries based on the **start date of the initiative**.

The operator can decide to switch the status of the opportunity to draft or delete it in the case of errors. Publication ends either when the end date for the opportunity is reached or if suspended by the Department.

{% hint style="info" %} The opportunities published on the portal **will not be immediately visible in App** as it is necessary to wait the technical update time of the views. 

The length of that delay is variable and can last from **2 hours up to maximum the next day** of publication on the portal.  {% endhint %}

## Suspended

The **suspended** status can be assigned to an opportunity:

* manually by the Department 

The **Department** can suspend the published opportunities visible in the IO app when the opportunities do not comply with what is declared by the operators or cannot be used by the beneficiaries. They can also be suspended if considered in contrast with the content or spirit of the program, following a signal by the beneficiaries or by the checks performed. 

* Automatically if the opportunity exhausts the associated list of static codes, if applicable, or if the operator changes the method of recognition associated with the opportunities they want to offer to the beneficiaries

When the opportunity is suspended it will no longer be visible on the IO app. The operator will receive an e-mail that communicates the suspension and the reason for it.   
To make the opportunity visible again on the IO app, the operator must change the details as requested and then publish it again. The opportunity published in this manner will be assessed again by the Department and will remain visible only if the requirements were respected.

## Expired

The **expired** status is assigned automatically by the system to opportunities that reach their natural end date. The operator is informed by means of an email to the representative of the expiration of the opportunity. Expired opportunities will no longer be visible on the IO app. To make an expired opportunity visible again, the operator can change the expiration date and publish it again.

{% hint style="info" %} Opportunities expire **at 11:59:59 pm on the date indicated** by the operator, visible also in the IO app. {% endhint %}
