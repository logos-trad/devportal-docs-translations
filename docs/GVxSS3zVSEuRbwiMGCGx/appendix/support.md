# Assistance

The Operator can request assistance using the functions indicated by the “_Do you need help_” link visible in the top right section of the Portal. 

The functions, which are activated also prior to authentication, make it possible to send a support request to the corresponding technical service, indicating the specific category (e.g. Data compilation), together with an explanatory message (maximum length of 200 characters).
