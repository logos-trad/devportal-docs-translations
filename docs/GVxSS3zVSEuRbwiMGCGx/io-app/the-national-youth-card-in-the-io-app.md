# The National Youth Card in the IO app

The National Youth Card is a digital-only tool and can be requested only via the IO app. Young people can request it from the:

* Wallet section > Add to wallet > National Youth Card;
* Services section > service tab "National Youth Card".

The request flow consists only in the age verification of the requester, and if suitable, the National Youth Card will be activated immediately.

Once the National Youth Card is activated, it will always be accessible in the Wallet section.

The detailed screen of the CGN includes:

* **The graphic of the National Youth Card (CGN)**  
The background of the card is animated to prevent the use of “improper” screenshots of the CGN by users;
* **The data of the beneficiary**  
In particular first and last name, fiscal code. The operator has the right to request an identification document for further verification;
* **Card state and details**  
If the “Active” badge is present, the card is valid. Other states are “Expired”, “Revoked”, “Suspended” and must not be accepted; 
* **Details about the EYCA card**  
In particular, card number and expiration date. These details and the EYCA logo on the CGN are displayed only to youth below the age of 31, for whom the EYCA card will be activated at the same time the CGN is issued.

{% hint style="info" %} Remember that the CGN **does not have a card number displayed**  or visible in the IO app {% endhint %}

## Statuses of the CGN

The card can have the following statuses:

* active;
* revoked;
* expired;
* suspended.

The card is active from the moment of its activation until the beneficiary turns 36. The user receives a message that informs them of the expiration of the card.

When the user turns 36, the status of the card becomes “expired”.

The Department can request PagoPA to revoke a CGN due to improper use by the beneficiary. In this case, the card is blocked, the EYCA card is revoked and the user cannot request a new Youth Card.

The “suspended” status is provided for possible suspension of the initiative by the Department.

The young person needs an “active” card to access the opportunities.
