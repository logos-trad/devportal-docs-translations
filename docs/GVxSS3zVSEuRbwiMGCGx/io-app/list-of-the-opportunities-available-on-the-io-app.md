The youth who is a beneficiary of the CGN and wants to access the list of opportunities accesses the CGN section of the IO app, touching "_Discover the opportunities_" and will land on a screen presenting the product categories and opportunities offered by the partners (operators) of the initiative (tab "_By category_")

By selecting a category, the beneficiary will land on a screen with a list that displays all the operators who joined the initiative, who have at least one currently valid opportunity that belongs to the selected category. 

Selecting "_By partner_" all the operators who have at least one opportunity published at that moment will be displayed.

The beneficiary can search the operators by pressing the magnifying glass icon, which activates the search bar. The beneficiary enters the keywords in the search bar and can search for correspondence with: 

* Operator name;
* Operator description.

Selecting an element in the list accesses the tab with the operator details, which displays:

* The name of the operator, which corresponds to the company name of the operator or an alias that was chosen directly by the operator;
* An image representing the operator;
* The list of the currently valid opportunities provided by the operator;
* A description of the operator;
* The web or physical address of the operator, or both, depending on if the operator operates only online, only in physical locations or uses both channels.

## Details of the opportunity

Selecting an opportunity open a _bottom sheet_ that presents the details:

* Name of the opportunity;
* Product category of the goods/services offered by the opportunity;
* A description, if applicable;
* The period of validity;
* Any conditions applicable to the opportunity;
* In the case of an online operator, the methods of accessing the opportunity, for which sample screens are shown here.
