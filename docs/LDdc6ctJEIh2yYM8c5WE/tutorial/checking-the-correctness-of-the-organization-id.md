# Checking the correctness of the Organization Id

The “Certification- Organization Id” e-service published in the catalog offers a service through which it is possible to **verify the presence and correctness of a certain id related to an organization or company,** simulating an institution that has the updated and centralized information from all the records of the organizations/companies.

This tutorial shows an actual case of using this service.

## The use case

As a user, I need to **verify** that the **IDs of the organizations** I have in my database are correct and still valid.  To do so, I must subscribe to the “Certification - Organization Id” e-service, which makes it possible to recover this data through the invocation of the following API:

`POST /organization-id-verification/check`
