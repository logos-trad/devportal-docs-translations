# Access via Single Sign-On

The Single Sign-On (SSO) function makes it possible to access third-party sites directly with the SPID/CIE authentication already used for IO, without having to log in again.

The IO messages and services therefore become a convenient access point toward the web platforms of institutions.

In this way, citizens are able to quickly access the reserved area on the institution&rsquo;s platform directly from the service tab without having to authenticate again with SPID or CIE. <br>This allows citizens to consult information or complete actions provided by the service quickly and easily.</td><td>✅</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Enter a button associated with an SSO link in a message</strong></td><td>This makes it possible to offer citizens simplified access to the portal or reserved area of the institution. It is possible to insert a button that sends the citizen directly to the specific section of the portal related to the requested action, such as registration or consultation of documents. The citizen does not heed to perform a new authentication with SPID or CIE, but will directly access the destination page and can immediately complete the flow.</td><td>✅</td></tr></tbody></table>
