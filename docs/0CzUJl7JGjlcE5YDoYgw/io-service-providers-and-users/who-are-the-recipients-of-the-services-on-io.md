# Who are the recipients of the services on IO

The public that receives the services provided by institutions on IO includes **anyone who has** [**SPID**](https://www.spid.gov.it/) (Public Digital Identity System) credentials or, alternatively, **an Electronic Identity Card (**[**CIE**](https://www.cartaidentita.interno.gov.it/)**)**. 

{% hint style="success" %} **A tool for everyone** 

IO is not only targeted toward Italian citizens, but also residents and anyone who can benefit from public services. {% endhint %}

### A right for citizens

According to [article 7](https://docs.italia.it/italia/piano-triennale-ict/codice-amministrazione-digitale-docs/it/v2018-09-28/_rst/capo1_sezione2_art7.html)[ ](https://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:decreto.legislativo:2005-03-07;82)of the Digital Administration Code, all citizens have the right to use the services provided by public bodies **in a digital form** **and in an integrated manner**, "using telematic tools provided by public administrations and the point of access specified in article 64-bis, also using mobile devices".

To make this right effective, all Public Administrations must design their digital services in a manner that guarantees integration and interoperability with the back office of IO, by reorganizing and updating their services **starting from the actual needs of users**.

The services that are proposed for being provided with the app must be based on this last principle, that is provide **value for the users**. For this reason, we recommend institutions to first make the services most used or requested available, or start with those that users find difficult to access using other channels.

The document that regulates how to create services that are **focused on citizens** are the [Design guidelines for internet sites and the digital services of the PA](https://docs.italia.it/italia/design/lg-design-servizi-web/it/versione-corrente/index.html), which define and orient the design and creation of the internet sites and digital services provided by Public Administrations. 

### Legal representatives on IO

Institutions can send messages via IO also to citizens who are a **Legal Representative** of a legal person, if their **fiscal code** is available and they have **something to communicate to the company** the person represents. 

{% hint style="warning" %} **Keep in mind**

1. We do not check the correspondence between the fiscal code indicated by the institution and the fiscal code of the legal representative of the legal person; 
2. The institution has the control and responsibility regarding the data they provide to us and for the messages they send; 
3. The messages the institution sends to the legal representative of the legal person are not a legal notice.  {% endhint %}

### What can citizens do with the services on IO?

Starting from their first access, app users must give their consent to be contacted by the services present on IO. The app provides two options:

* **Quick configuration:** all the services that are or will be on IO can send messages to the user. The user can then manually deactivate the services from which they do not want to receive communications by deactivating the “Contact you in-app” option that is located on every service tab.
* **Manual configuration**: no service can send messages to the user. The user must activate communication individually by activating the “Contact you in-app” option that is located on every service tab.

{% hint style="info" %} **The advantages of quick configuration**

In the app we recommend choosing the quick configuration in order to not miss any message that is sent. {% endhint %}
