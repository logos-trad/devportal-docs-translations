# Button with Call to action (CTA)

The services offered by the institutions on IO often refer the user to **websites or portals** there they can access services or receive more information.

To make this easier, the service card and messages can contain a **button with action** (called _**Call To Action**_\*\* or CTA\*\*). When the user presses the button, they are directed to the website or portal defined by the institution.

The button with Call to action can be: 

* A link that leads the user to a third-party website; 
* A link that via Single Sign-On leads the user to a reserved area of a third-party website of the institution without having to perform another SPID/CIE authentication. 

{% hint style="info" %} **Did you know?** 

[Single Sign-On](../../io-app/the-functions-of-io-available-to-institutions/access-via-single-sign-on.md) is the function that makes it possible to directly access third-party websites using the IO SPID/CIE authentication.  {% endhint %}

**What is a Call to action?**   
It is a clear and direct invitation that pushes the user to perform a specific and immediate action.

It is an important element that should be appreciated, because it:

* Helps users orient themselves;
* Permits specific and immediate choices;
* Acts as a bridge and permits interaction between various interfaces.

**To make best use of its potential, therefore, the button must:**

* Contain a clear and incisive Call to Action:
* Clearly describe the action that the user is about to perform;
* Be pertinent to the objective of the service and the message;
* Contain a brief text, with simple language and common words.

Here are some examples of correct and incorrect buttons:
