# Test message sent to citizens

When sending a test message, make sure to follow the [information in the technical guide](https://docs.pagopa.it/io-guida-tecnica/funzionalita/inviare-un-messaggio), to prevent errors when sending it.

If a test message is still sent to citizens, we suggest sending another message correcting the error based on this template:

**`Title:`**`Message sent by mistake`

**`Text of the message`**`:`

`Hello,`

`We are writing you to inform you that the message with the title`` `**`[title of the message]`**` ``was sent to you in error. Therefore please ignore its content`` `**`[, including the attached payment notice]`**`.`

`We are sorry for the inconvenience.`

{% hint style="danger" %} **Important**

Regardless of the type of error, if it was caused by a technological partner or by the aggregator, **the message must always be in the name of the institution sending the original message**: citizens do not know the technological partners and this could create further confusion for them. {% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %} **Any questions?** Before sending an error correction message, **contact IO support**, accessing your [**reserved area for institutions**](https://selfcare.pagopa.it/auth/login) and pressing **support**.

Remember that the institution sending the message is solely responsible for the content of the messages. {% endhint %}
