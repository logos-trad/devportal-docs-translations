# Wrong recipients

Also in this case, before sending a message we suggest to **always check that the list of recipients is correct**. If a message is still sent to incorrect recipients, we suggest sending another message correcting the error based on this template:

**`Title:`**` ``Error correction + title of the incorrect message`

**`Text of the message`**`:`

`Hello,`

`We are writing you to inform you that the message with the title`` `**`[title of the message]`**` ``was sent to you in error. Therefore please ignore its content`` `**`[, including the attached payment notice]`**`.`

`We are sorry for the inconvenience.`

{% hint style="info" %} **Any questions?** Before sending an error correction message, **contact IO support**, accessing your [**reserved area for institutions**](https://selfcare.pagopa.it/auth/login) and pressing **support**.

Remember that the institution sending the message is solely responsible for the content of the messages. {% endhint %}
