# The IO service catalogs

The [IO service catalogs](https://developer.pagopa.it/app-io/guides/v1.0-catalogo-dei-servizi) are lists created considering the services that are most important, significant and frequent in the IO app and **is intended for institutions and their technological partners**. 

The catalogs are dedicated to specific types of institutions:

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Municipalities</strong></td><td></td><td><a href="https://docs.pagopa.it/v1.0-catalogo-dei-servizi/catalogo-dei-servizi-dei-comuni"><strong>Go to the catalog -&gt;</strong></a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Regions and autonomous provinces</strong></td><td></td><td><a href="https://docs.pagopa.it/v1.0-catalogo-dei-servizi/catalogo-dei-servizi-regioni-e-province-autonome"><strong>Go to the catalog -&gt;</strong></a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Health care</strong></td><td>(ASL and AO)</td><td><a href="https://docs.pagopa.it/v1.0-catalogo-dei-servizi/catalogo-dei-servizi-sanita"><strong>Go to the catalog -&gt;</strong></a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>University</strong></td><td>(University, AFAM and research institutions)</td><td><a href="https://docs.pagopa.it/v1.0-catalogo-dei-servizi/catalogo-dei-servizi-universita"><strong>Go to the catalog -&gt;</strong></a></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Why use it? 

If your institution choses the services to publish among those in the catalog: 

* They will have the service tab available that the institution can republish without any changes or after eliminating one or more points after “Via IO"; 
* The service will certainly pass the verification phase.

{% hint style="info" %} If the institution prefers publishing a service that is not included in the catalog, they can do so. The service will be submitted to a **manual check** and will be evaluated according to what is written in this manual. Therefore, approval is not ensured — unlike when selecting a service already in the catalog. {% endhint %}
