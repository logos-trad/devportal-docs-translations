# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

## What is the purpose of the pagoPA payment notice?

The payment notice allows all citizens to have a unique instrument (paper or digital) to perform payments via the pagoPA platform in an easy and direct manner.

The purpose of this document is to uniform the production of these notices by the creditors, using the same design rules, in order to:

1. **Provide the same user experience** to all system users;
2. **Ensure legibility**, coherence and completeness of contents;
3. **Guarantee multi-channels,** maximizing the possibility that the notice is payable through all authorized channels. 

## What is the model to use?

There are different models of reference to best support the various payment types. The models must be used by the creditors affiliated with pagoPA who offer payment services activated at the PSP.
