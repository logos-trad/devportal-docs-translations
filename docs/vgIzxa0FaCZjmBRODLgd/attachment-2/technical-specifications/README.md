# üìê Technical specifications

{% hint style="info" %} Are you looking for information to create print formats? See the section [design elements](../design-elements/ "mention")! {% endhint %}

## Page format

The specifications are intended to guarantee reproducibility in an A4 format suitable for printing. The [variants](../../attachment-1/variants/ "mention") section provides other formats, such as those suitable for receipts of portable thermal transfer printers.

## Back-front printing

It is possible to print the pagoPA payment notice on both sides of a sheet of page, making sure to select a paper density that does not make it difficult to read the provided information, in particular the [qr-code.md](payment-data/qr-code.md "mention").

## Text coding

It is mandatory to use the coding of UTF-8 characters that support all the Unicode characters, including those extended to languages such as Slovenian (ƒç, ≈°, ≈æ) and German (√§, √∂, √º, √ü). This guarantees that multi-language texts can be correctly displayed and managed.

## Page structure

The payment notice is comprised of various modules. There are some fixed and other variables based on the type of payment and the way in which the creditor manages collections.

{% hint style="info" %} When you create your model, respect the order for entering the modules described on this page‚Äîbut always think of the structure in a _dynamic_ manner: if your payment does not have a single installment, you can enter the installment details already on page 1. {% endhint %}

| Order| Name|
|----------|----------|
| 1| [header.md](header.md "mention")|
| 2.1| [information-about-the-creditor.md](information-about-the-creditor.md "mention")|
| 2.2| [information-about-the-recipient.md](information-about-the-recipient.md "mention")|
| 3.1| [amount-and-due-date.md](amount-and-due-date.md "mention")|
| 3.2| [where-to-pay.md](where-to-pay.md "mention")|
| 4| [Payment data](payment-data/ "mention")|

## Placeholder variable and texts <a href="#variabili" id="variabili"></a>

The various pages that describe the modules use placeholder texts, which are identified by keys according to the syntax ""property1.property2"", such as, for example, [#avviso-importo](amount-and-due-date.md#avviso-importo "mention") or [#destinatario-cf](information-about-the-recipient.md#destinatario-cf "mention").

The images, instead, are shown with gray blocks‚Äîidentified always with a variable (e.g.:   [#avviso-qrcode](payment-data/single-installment.md#avviso-qrcode "mention")).

The data models that include all the possible variables used in the notice is the follows:
