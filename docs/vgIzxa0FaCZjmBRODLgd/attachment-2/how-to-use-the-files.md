# ❓ How to use the files

{% hint style="info" %} The provided files **are not to be considered files ready for direct printing**. Their use is limited to the design and development phase by those who create the actual executive files, optimized for the printing process. {% endhint %}

{% include "../.gitbook/includes/novita-e-ora-possibile-gen....md" %}

## View the files online with Figma

### What is [Figma](https://figma.com)?

It is a web-app used to design interfaces and vector graphics. It is used not only to design elements, but also to collect feedback, collaborate simultaneously with other users and allows operators —such as developers or printers—to read the specifications for implementation purposes.

### How is it used?

The models shown on this website can be viewed without having to register: it is possible to zoom and view the contents directly on the page.

To check the specifications, simply click on an element on the page: the relative properties(_Content, Typography, Colors_) will appear on the _Inspect_ panel to the right. 

{% hint style="info" %} A free account is necessary to consult the read-only specifications and access the Inspect panel.

{% hint style="info" %} It is not possible to request access for editing purposes. If you want, you can download a local copy from the menu _(F) Figma > File > Save a local copy..._ {% endhint %}

## Download files in SVG format

### What is the SVG format?

It is an open format used to open and inspect the model in any vector graphics software, such as Adobe Illustrator.

### How is it used?

Open the file in your vector graphics software and click on the various elements to see their properties, such as text dimensions and colors.

{% hint style="info" %} Before opening a model, make sure to have installed the various  [fonts](design-elements/typography.md). {% endhint %}
