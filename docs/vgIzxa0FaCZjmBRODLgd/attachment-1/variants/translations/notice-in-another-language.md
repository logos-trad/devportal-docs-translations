# Notice in another language

{% hint style="info" %} In this model, the texts of the Where to pay section are slightly different, because they are directed at citizens who do not necessarily live in Italy. {% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %} If the creditor has a postal current account for collections, also the [postal-payment-slip.md](../../../attachment-2/technical-specifications/payment-data/postal-payment-slip.md "mention") must be included. {% endhint %}
