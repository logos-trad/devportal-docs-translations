If the payment notice includes multiple installments, for example in the case of a fine, a model can be used that is designed to optimize printing and include multiple installments on the same page.

# Notice with multiple installments

{% hint style="danger" %} Use this model only if your notice has a high number of installments, **minimum of 9.** In all other cases, refer to the layout described in [#rate-multiple](../../attachment-2/technical-specifications/payment-data/#rate-multiple "mention"). {% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %} If the creditor has a postal current account for collections, also the installments must be included in the format [postal-payment-slip.md](../../attachment-2/technical-specifications/payment-data/postal-payment-slip.md "mention").  For more information, refer to [#layout-con-multipli-di-3](../../attachment-2/technical-specifications/payment-data/postal-payment-slip.md#layout-con-multipli-di-3 "mention"). {% endhint %}
