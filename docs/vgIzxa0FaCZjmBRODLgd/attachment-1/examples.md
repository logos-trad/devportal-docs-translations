## Notice with multiple installments

The multi-installment layouts make it possible to insert multiples of 2 or 3 installments in a single row. Depending on the configuration of the tax and the creditor’s collection method, it is possible to condense all the information on a single sheet, as done by [ANAS S.p.A.](https://www.stradeanas.it/it) and l'[Unione dei Comuni Adige Gua'](http://www.unioneadigegua.it/).

### 2 installments

## Notice for traffic code violations

PagoPA has collaborated with the [Municipality of Vicenza](https://www.comune.vicenza.it/) to simplify the notice related to traffic code violations: now the notice provides a more simple explanation of how to calculate the due dates —and be sure to benefit from discounted or reduced amounts—and what to do in the case of undelivered mail.

### Formats for thermal printers

Various variants are also provided for on-site printing by the local police, both for immediate fines (example to the left) as well as for ticket notices (example to the right).

## Notices for foreign students

PagoPA has collaborated with the [University of Rome Tor Vergata](https://web.uniroma2.it/it) to create a bilingual model, without the need to print additional sheets—in order to help foreign students pay their university fees.
