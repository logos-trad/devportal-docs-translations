# Debt positions

With the **debt position** service, PagoPA aims to offer the technical management of the debt positions to Technological partners, Technological intermediaries and even directly to Creditors that require it. “Management” means both the component that concerns the creation, update and cancellation of debt positions - possibly also starting from requests for **spontaneous payment** - as well as the component of paying the positions themselves via the payment node.

In addition to updating the state of the debt positions following the dialog with the pagoPA platform for performing the payments, the service also makes functions available for recovering the reporting flows provided by the PSPs.

As regards the **spontaneous payments**, functions are made available so the single services can be registered for by the Technological partners, Technological intermediaries and even directly by the Creditors who are interested.

Registering with the service is voluntary, for the procedure refer to the [_pagopa BackOffice_](https://docs.pagopa.it/manuale-back-office-pagopa) manual, section [API key generation](https://docs.pagopa.it/manuale-back-office-pagopa/manuale-operativo-back-office-pagopa-creditor/funzionalita/generazione-api-key).
