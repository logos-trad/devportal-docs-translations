# ðŸ–Š What is Sign with IO?

Sign with IO is a service that allows:

* citizens to **sign documents and contracts** via the IO app in a simple, quick and secure manner;
* institutions to **manage all the signature processes** in a single place.

{% hint style="success" %} Sign with IO generates a **Qualified Electronic Signature** (QES), with a "one shot" certificate. It has maximum probative legal value, equal to a wet signature, and does not have any regulatory exclusion. {% endhint %}

### Benefits for citizens

The function guarantees the following benefits to citizens:

* **simple and secure user experience**: the protocol used guarantees that the signer coincides with the person from whom the institution requested the signature, and that they did it voluntarily;
* **familiarity of the channel**: adoption is helped by the familiarity of the IO app already integrated with the signature provider;
* **multichannel service**: it can be started both from the IO app, via a message, as well as from the website of the PA, via QR code;
* **a free signature, equivalent to a wet signature**:qualified electronic signatures (QES) have maximum probative legal value.

### Benefits for the institutions

* **digitalization**: the processes that require an in-person signature and/or scanning of the PDF are digitalized;
* **liability shift**: guarantees a secure system that prevents any risk of repudiation;
* **simple adoption and high scalability**: guarantees the management of more than 100 signatures per second.
