# âš’ Environments: Test \& Production

Once the standard contract is completed for the service and when accessing the [Reserved Area](https://selfcare.pagopa.it/auth/login?onSuccess=dashboard), you will always have to separate environments available, one dedicated to the **Tests** and one dedicated to **Production**. This makes it possible to perform internal tests on additional documents or contracts without any additional cost and without interfering with the operational process in production for users.

{% hint style="info" %} It is currently possible to autonomously generate only the API keys destined for the test environment. To obtain the API keys for the production environment, it is necessary to complete integration with the service. 

Once you have completed the integration, contact us at   
firmaconio-tech@pagopa.it to receive the production API keys!  {% endhint %}
