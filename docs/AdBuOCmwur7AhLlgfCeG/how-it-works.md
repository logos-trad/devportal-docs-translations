### What do the citizens do?

A citizen who was requested to sign:

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:blue;">Step 1</mark>: Receives a message on IO or presses a button from the institution&rsquo;s website</summary>

The citizen can start the signature process in two ways: by receiving a **message on IO** with the signature request or by pressing the **"Sign with IO"** button on the institution's website.

If they select the second method and use it from the desktop, they must scan the generated QR code with their smartphone.

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:blue;">Step 2</mark>: Read the document and sign it</summary>

The citizen views the document on the IO app. Select which optional clauses to sign and proceed with the **qualified electronic signature (QES)** using the unlock code of the app or their own biometric recognition system.

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:blue;">Step 3</mark>: Receive the signed document</summary>

Receive the **signed document** via a new message on the IO app.

</details>
