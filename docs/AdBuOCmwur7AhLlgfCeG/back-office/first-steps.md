# üë©üíª Getting started

Here are the steps you must follow after signing the standard contract to be able to start integrating Sign with IO.

{% hint style="info" %} Keep in mind that you can always indicate a **different support email address** for each dossier, as shown in the section "[Create the dossier](https://docs.pagopa.it/manuale-operativo-di-firma-con-io/creare-il-dossier#vuoi-aggiungere-una-email-di-assistenza-specifica-per-il-dossier)" {% endhint %}

<summary>Step 2 - Select Sign with IO</summary>

After entering the Reserved Area of your institution, select ‚ÄúSign with IO‚Äù from the list of active products. Then you will land on the "**Overview**" page, where you can always:

1. **Change the support address of the institution** that was indicated when registering, as a reference to give citizens who request support for questions directed to the institution (e.g. the sent document contains an error)
2. View the **references related to the integration and production phase to request technical support**.

The **Integration phase** is the phase in which you are integrating Sign with IO for the first time and therefore you are performing various tests to understand how it functions correctly. The **Production phase** starts instead when you are ready to send the signature requests (at costs specified in the contract) to all the users who use the IO app!

<summary>Step 3 - Generate and manage the API keys</summary>

The "**API key**" panel allows you to generate and manage the API keys to use for the test environment and manage the API keys for the production environment.

For each **new test API key** you must:

1. **Assign a name** that identifies the API key or use the one set automatically;
2. **Add one or more IP addresses** of the machines that send requests;
3. **Add one or more fiscal codes** of the people (already uses of the IO app) who will tests the various flows.

<mark style="color:red;">**Remember that you cannot test the flow if you do not enter IP addresses or fiscal codes**</mark>[<mark style="color:red;">**!**</mark>](#user-content-fn-1)\[\^1\]

<summary>Step 4 - Start using your API keys</summary>

After generating and populating the API keys, all you have to do now is use them!
