# Identify the signature fields

You must identify the **signature fields**  for each document â€” meaning the points where the citizen will place their signature. For each field, you must indicate:

* A **title** that will be displayed to the user in app before proceeding with the signature; 
* The type of clause associated: **mandatory, unfair or optional.**

{% hint style="warning" %} The title must not exceed **70 characters**, spaces included.  
Write in **uppercase** only at the beginning of the phrase, for acronyms, proper names or names of institutions

(e.g.: Sign for contract acceptance) {% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %} You must enter this information in the dossier that you will create when requesting the signature: you can find all the information in [Creation of a dossier](../../../create-the-dossier.md). {% endhint %}

### How to identify the signature fields

Currently you can identify the signature field in the documents:

{% content-ref url="via-coordinates.md" %} [via-coordinates.md](via-coordinates.md) {% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="warning" %} **Can I enter the signature fields using software such as Adobe Acrobat Pro?**

Due to a Google bug, if you enter the signature fields using software, the graphic signatures will not be rendered correctly when opening the .pdf from Chrome   
(on an Android device or Chrome browser on a desktop). Therefore we recommend entering the signature fields [via coordinates](via-coordinates.md).  {% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %} **What happens if you do not insert any signature field or coordinate?**

If you do not insert a signature field, the user can insert **only one digital signature on the entire document**. This is a qualified electronic signature that is valid for all purposes and verifiable using readers such as Acrobat Reader DC, which however **will not have a corresponding image** on the document (transparent signature).  
For more details, go to: [Obtain the signed documents](../../../obtain-signed-documents.md).  {% endhint %}
