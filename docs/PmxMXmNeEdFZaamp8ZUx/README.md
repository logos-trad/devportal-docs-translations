# Introduction

## Context <a href="#contesto" id="contesto"></a>

For an institution, both a public administration (PA) or a private subject, the data as well as their _variations_ are of interest. Data variation means, for example, a change in the residence of a subject or the renewal of a driver's license.

Within the context of the PAs, to follow up on an administrative procedure it is necessary to know the variations to the data of the involved subjects owned by other PAs, during the period in which the administrative procedure is current. For a private subject it is just as important to be able to access data that is always updated.

**Signal Hub** is a PDND Interoperability service that _**concentrates**_\*\* (hub)\*\* the variation of data and distributes the notifications. The _**signal**_ is the notification that data was changed.  The service is designed to ensure member subjects the distribution of data variation signals.

## Reason <a href="#motivo" id="motivo"></a>

The concentration of data updates in a single platform service guarantees:

* security within the perimeter of the PDND Interoperability guidelines
* cost effectiveness: reduction in the number of calls and resources an e-service provider must handle
* confidentiality: data known only by the producers and consumers
* administrative uniformity: it is not necessary to stipulate new agreements between members
* technical standardization: homogeneous technical solution to access data variations
