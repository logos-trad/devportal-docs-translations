# Name of the service

First of all, check if the service is included among the [models of the most common services](https://github.com/pagopa/devportal-docs/blob/docs/from-gitbook/docs/UPXI5qlLme7xci8KwDxf/catalogo-dei-servizi-e-modelli/i-modelli-dei-servizi-piu-frequenti/README.md): if it is, we recommend following the instructions and using the name of the service indicated in the relative model. Otherwise, here are some rules to follow for finding a correct name.

**Name of the service**:

* it must describe the **purpose of the service** – identity card, voting card, TARI (tax on waste) – in three or four words;
* it must be written in **lowercase** and not uppercase letters, unless it is an acronym – for example not "SCHOOL CAFETERIA" but “School cafeteria".
* **must not contain the tools or steps** that are required for it, or words such as "Payment(s)", "Deadline(s)", "Communication(s)”, "Notification(s)", "Information", "Check(s)", "Invitation(s)", "Registration(s)", "Concession(s)" and "Request(s)". These words can be part of any service and therefore must not be used in the title.

**The evolution of services**

This rule is important also from the point of view of the evolution of the service: in the future, the service can do much more than help make a payment. Think about the title as described above, so it remains current even in the case of future changes and evolutions.
{% endhint %}

* it must not contain **acronyms that are not well known**;
* it must not contain **the name of the institution providing it**;
* it must not contain the word **"Notification"**. IO does not send "notifications", rather it sends "messages". Depending on the user preferences, they can also generate push notifications;
* it must not contain the word **"online”** or **"digital"**.

Here are some examples of correct and incorrect service names.
