# Publication

Once the service is approved, it can be **published** on the app. Every institution can publish a service, cancel its publication or change it.

A validated service can have one of these two states:

* **visible:** the service is visible in the app to users;
* **not visible:** the service is no longer visible to users in the app but remains in the back office of the institution, which can publish it again at any moment.
