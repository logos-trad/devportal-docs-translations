# Electronic Identity Card

Providing the ‚ÄúElectronic Identity Card‚Äù service via IO makes it possible for institutions to:

* provide citizens with detailed communications about the state of their Electronic Identity Card (CIE), covering the **entire life cycle of the service**, from the beginning to the end;
* integrate communications, avoiding a duplication of communications regarding the expiration of the CIE, managed by ANPR.

**A model to be customized**

The procedures for this service vary greatly among institutions. We recommend using the message texts as a starting point and adding additional information.

The model is an example that is not binding for the institution and for which the Company does not accept any liability, as it serves only as an example.

You can copy the messages to be customized from [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aTFHoaigZPdJ42-7rijDWTCsNzhc4J4vwZ0Trt7lZug/edit#gid=538647580).
