# Vehicle towing

Providing the ‚ÄúVehicle towing‚Äù service via IO makes it possible for institutions to:

* **update citizens in real time** and therefore allow them to pay for the fees for the towing or impounding of their vehicles;
* **reduce the times** and costs for the process of notification and delivery of the fine;
* **speed up the times** for recovering the vehicle if it was impounded or towed.

The final objective is to send all of them, releasing service versions that are increasingly complete.

**A model to be customized**

The procedures for this service vary greatly among institutions. We recommend using the message texts as a starting point and adding additional information.

The model is an example that is not binding for the institution and for which the Company does not accept any liability, as it serves only as an example.

You can copy the messages to be customized from [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xveBu0d5oxLGI2alfBJxg181uqNMIiPrX6RZZP67K5k/edit#gid=538647580).
