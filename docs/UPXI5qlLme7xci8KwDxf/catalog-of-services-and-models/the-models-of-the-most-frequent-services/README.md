# The most frequent service models

This section contains some models that are useful for helping institutions configure their services on IO and process the texts of the messages that are sent. Specifically, these messages can be useful for:

* **defining the list of services** that the institution wants to offer with IO;
* **defining the series of messages** that each service sends to users and when they are sent;
* preparing the information necessary for **preparing the service tab**;
* **creating a coherent experience**.

Each model contains the name of the service, the description, the thematic taxonomy data, the message texts and the relative moments when they must be sent.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Is your service not one of these models?**
