# Tax on waste (TARI)

Providing the ‚ÄúTARI‚Äù service via IO makes it possible for institutions to:

* provide citizens with timely communications about the state of their TARI, covering the **entire life cycle of the service**.
* provide citizens with a single point of reference for receiving communications concerning TARI for **one or more properties, also in different municipalities** and with different regulations, if present on IO.

## **Service messages**

{% hint style="success" %}
**The ideal service**

The series of all messages represents the ideal service. The institution that wants to provide this service can evaluate which and how many messages to send depending on their possibility of integration. The final objective is to send all of them, releasing service versions that are increasingly complete.

## Some suggestions

In order to enrich communications with information that is valuable for citizens, we recommend:

* including some **data of reference for the property** to allow the user to identify the subject of the message and differentiate it if they have multiple properties.
* including one or more links that refer to **information concerning waste disposal management** and how to correctly separate waste.

**Did you know?**\
IO is integrated with SEND - Digital Notification Service, to send legally binding communications.

[**Discover more about SEND**](https://www.pagopa.it/it/prodotti-e-servizi/piattaforma-notifiche-digitali) [**-->**](https://www.pagopa.it/it/prodotti-e-servizi/piattaforma-notifiche-digitali)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**A model to be customized**

The procedures for this service vary greatly among institutions. We recommend using the message texts as a starting point and adding or changing content as required.

The model is an example that is not binding for the institution and for which the Company does not accept any liability, as it serves only as an example.

You can copy the messages to be customized from [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18Zmo5px\_P--N5MigMPf19P9znlcoOh-d-DOdXqH4v0Q/edit#gid=538647580).
