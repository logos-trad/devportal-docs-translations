# Notification Platform - Operating Manual

The Notification Platform is a legally binding notification service that can be used by any Public administration for the notification of documents to any physical or legal person, institution or association that has a fiscal code. The Notification Platform simplifies the management of notifications for the sending Public administration, as they only have to deposit the document to be notified on the platform. The Notification Platform takes care of processing the notification, selecting the best notification path (digital and/or analog) among those defined by the regulation.

The Notification Platform also simplifies the notification process for digital recipients, i.e. those with a digital identity and can be reached at their digital domicile (PEC/SERCQ) or via IOapp/email/sms. These recipients also benefit from a considerable reduction in costs.

The Notification Platform however does not forget the analog recipients who can still receive notifications, however at a higher cost, and use the service through people close to them and/or delegated by them.
