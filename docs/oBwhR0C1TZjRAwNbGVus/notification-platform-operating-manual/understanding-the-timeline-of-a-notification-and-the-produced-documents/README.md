# Understanding the timeline of a notification and the produced documents

The notification follows a life cycle whereby it passes through a series of statuses that are tracked and displayed on the NP portal through the notification timeline.

 The various statuses of the notification can generate certificates enforceable against third parties that can be accessed and downloaded using the relative links.

ATTENTION: in some cases, multiple statuses refer to the same certificate enforceable against third parties. For example, all the various attempts to forward the PEC are grouped into a single certificate enforceable against third parties.

The various statuses differ depending on the notification path used and are indicated in the following paragraphs. Some statuses are incorporated in the timeline: for example the acceptance and completion for the sender are incorporated into the “Deposited” status

The timeline initially presents only the events that determine a change in the notification status. Secondary events (for example, the different attempts to send a PEC) are available by opening the “Show more” sections. Any documents connected to the secondary events are also available through the links present in the main events.
