# Rotating the API key

By selecting an active API key, the user rotates it by pressing the “Rotate” button. This requests the NP to generate a new secret.

This operation will create a new version of the API key using the new secret.

The previous version remains active until it is explicitly blocked but it can no longer be rotated.
