# Display of notifications for the sender

Selecting “Notifications” displays the page displaying the notifications sent by the PA.

The user can view and has access to only the notifications that were labeled with groups to which the user belongs, as well as ones without a label and therefore accessible to all enabled users.

The display shows the notifications, starting from the most recent one, in table form, with information regarding the date the notification was sent, the fiscal code of the recipient(s), the IUN code (if labeled) and notification status.

The user can set filters to change the view of the list, the available filters are: Recipient fiscal code, IUN code, time interval and status of the notification.

The notifications are present on pages of 10, 20, 50 elements each. The page size can be selected by the user.\\
