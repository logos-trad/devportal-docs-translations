# Termination of request by PagoPA S.p.A.

If PagoPA S.p.A. undertakes a termination action, the process takes place outside the SelfCare portal and, once termination and the termination due dates of the services and the termination of access have been defined, the termination process is managed by NP technical support personnel.

Also in this case, the sending PA will have an initial period in which they can continue accessing in read-only mode and a second period where it will no longer be possible to access NP.
