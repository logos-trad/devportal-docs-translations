# Termination request from the PA

If it is the sending PA that requests to terminate its operability on NP, the process takes place in the section dedicated to NP in the reserved area on the SelfCare portal where an administrator representative accesses, first selecting the sending PA for which they work, starting the termination process by compiling the de-registration letter made available on the portal, where they indicate the information of the signing entity (indicating the first and last name, fiscal code and e-mail of the signing entity, working as the legal representative and/or their special proxy).

The de-registration letter will be sent to the digital domicile of the sending PA and indicate two time moments: the moment of termination the NP services for the PA (90 days following the countersigned termination letter) and the moment of termination of access for the PA to the data residing on the NP and those related to the PA (180 days following termination of the services).

The de-registration letter must be digitally countersigned and uploaded to the portal using the link provided in the PEC.

PagoPa S.p.A verifies the existence of the digital signature and the correspondence of the signer with the person indicated during registration and, in the case of a positive outcome: for the prenotice period of 90 calendar days, the activities of the sending PH on the NP will not change. For the next 180 days, starting from the end of the above-indicated prenotice phase, the sending PA can access only in read-only mode.

Prior to the moment of terminating the services, everything takes place as if the PA did not start the removal process.

After the moment of terminating the services, but before the moment when access is terminated, enabled users of the PA can continue to access the NP but all the operations that modify the status of the NP are disabled; therefore it is not possible to send new notifications or make changes to the configuration.

After the moment access is terminated, the enabled users of NP can no longer access the NP as administrative or technical representatives of the PA.

NP keeps the PA's configuration information until the system no longer contains notifications sent by the PA. If the PA performs a new onboarding procedure, this information is restored.
