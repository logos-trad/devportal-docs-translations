The PAs are users of the NP who can generate notifications both manually on the web portal as well as automatically by means of B2B integration. The PAs can obviously also be recipients of notifications; in this case the PA is seen as a legal person and the management of the notifications as a recipient for the PAs is covered in the chapter dedicated to legal persons.
