# Self Care portal reserved area

To be able to deposit notifications on NP, a PA must first of all complete the onboarding process in the **Reserved Area** provided by PagoPA through the **Self Care** portal, identifying the official authorized to manage this process, as the legal representative of the institution, which includes the legal aspects of defining the contract and the designation of persons who can have access to NP in roles of administrator representative and technical representative.

**Self Care is a B2B web portal dedicated to all institutions that collaborate with PagoPA: Public administrations, Public Service Operators, and in the future PSP and technological partners and coincides with the reserved area of the institution** .
