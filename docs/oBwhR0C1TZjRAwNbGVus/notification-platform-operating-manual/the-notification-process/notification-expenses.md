# Notification expenses

The notification expenses for the sending PA differ based on the channel used to complete the notification process until completion for the recipient.

The sending PA has the right to request NP to accurately manage the notification expenses to be requested from the recipient or to apply a flat rate cost determined directly by the sending PA.

In any case, NP will invoice the sending PA for the effective notification fees for each recipient of the notification. In the case of multiple recipients, the payment will be made available to all the recipients until the payment is made by one of them (the first who makes the payment). The notification costs for reaching the other recipients must be collected directly by the PA.

In order to correctly determine the amount to pay in case of a payment to be made via pagoPA, NP makes a specific API available to the sending PA that, after providing the Notice Code and the fiscal code of the creditor for the payment, returns the cost of the notification and the date of completion for the recipient. This information can also be deduced by the PA using the information related to the status of the notification provided by NP.
