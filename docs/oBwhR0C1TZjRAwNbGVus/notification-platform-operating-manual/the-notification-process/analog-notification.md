# Analog notification

If a digital domicile was not indicated, the NCR is forwarded directly to the physical address of the recipient via 890 or registered letter with return receipt. The sender is responsible for indicating which of the two channels to be used.

If the sender did not specify a physical domicile address for the recipient, NP will search for a physical address in the ANPR (National Registry of the Resident Population), if the recipient is a physical person, or in the Business Register if the recipient is a legal person present in the register. NP will send the notification to that physical address.

NP will receive updates from the postal operator regarding the status of the delivery and the certified digital copy of each document generated during the notification (e.g. receipt signed by the recipient). These documents are stored in NP in an immutable manner and connected to the IUN to be able to find them through the NP portal.

If the recipient cannot be reached at the physical address that was provided, the postal operator will try to determine a second physical forwarding address provided to NP. NP will try at this point to determine a second address for sending the notification as follows:

If a new physical address is identified, NP attempts the notification a second time using the same methods, except for the absence of the verification of existence of a new physical address.

If the recipient is completely unreachable, the NCR will still be available for the recipient on the NP portal or through other mechanisms for accessing the documents as described above.

The notification is completed for the recipient 10 days after the delivery of the NCR or 10 days after its failure.

If the physical sending address is in a foreign country, the notification will be sent using an International Registered Letter with return receipt regardless of what was indicated by the sending PA. In this case it is not possible to ask the postal operator to search for a new address if the delivery fails. If the destination address is in a country that cannot be reached by international postal services, the recipient will be considered unreachable.
