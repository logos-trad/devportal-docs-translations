# Management of delegations

Legal persons manage the delegations using the same methods described in the Senders section, but with the following differences:

* Only administrator users can create and manage delegations in which the legal person is the delegator
* Only administrator users can accept delegations. Upon acceptance, a delegation can be associated with a group. In this case, the delegation can be managed by a group administrator, otherwise it must be managed by an administrator
* The notifications related to a delegation assigned to a group can be viewed and managed by group administrators and group technicians
* The notifications related to a delegation not assigned to a group must be viewed and managed by administrators and technicians
