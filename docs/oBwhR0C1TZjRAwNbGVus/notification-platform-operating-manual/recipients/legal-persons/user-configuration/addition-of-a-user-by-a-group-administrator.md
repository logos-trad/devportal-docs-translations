# Addition of a user by a group administrator

The group administrator user adds a user by pressing the “Add user” button.

The user provides their fiscal code, first and last name, email address, role (group administrator or group technician) and the group to which the user belongs among those the user manages.

If creating a new group administrator, they can be associated with more than one group.
