# Deletion of a user

The administrator or group administrator user removes a user by selecting them from the list and pressing the “Remove” button.

The deletion of a user blocks access to the person in the role of employee of the physical person: the next time they access NP, the person will no longer see the option to access on behalf of the physical person. The person will remain enabled to access in other roles or for themselves.
