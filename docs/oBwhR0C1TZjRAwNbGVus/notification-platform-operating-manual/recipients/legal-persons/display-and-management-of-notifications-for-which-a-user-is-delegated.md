# Display and management of notifications for which a user is delegated

Administrative and technical users access the notifications for which they are delegated on the “Delegated notifications” tab of the received notification display page, which are managed in the same way as described in the Senders section.

Group administrator and group technical users access only the notifications related to delegations assigned to their group of reference. These notifications are presented on the main NP page as described above.
