# Addition of other addresses

The operation is not permitted if there is not a PEC/SERCQ address in the “Legal address” box and/or an email/cell phone in the “Email or SMS” box

The user can indicate additional PEC/SERCQ addresses, emails or cell phone numbers to be associated with notifications coming from specific institutions, that NP will therefore use as an address only for the communications originating from one of them. It is not possible to configure multiple addresses of the same type for the same institution.
