# Deletion of a legal address

By selecting an existing PEC/SERCQ address and pressing the “Delete” button, the NP requests confirmation of the operation and then removes the contact from the system.

If the user indicated other PEC/SERCQ addresses associated with specific institutions under “Other addresses”, NP informs that they must first be deleted to proceed.
