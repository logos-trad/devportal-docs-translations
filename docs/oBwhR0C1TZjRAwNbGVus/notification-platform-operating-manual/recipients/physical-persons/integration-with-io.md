# Integration with IO

NP is integrated with IO app to provide the user with a courtesy notice and quick access to display and pay for the notifications.

When receiving the first notification, NP asks the user, via the IO app, if they want to use the app to receive courtesy notices from NP. The user can change the setting later for the management of the services on the IO app as well as the configuration of the addresses present on NP.

Once the NP “Courtesy notices” service is enabled on the IO app, all the courtesy messages are sent to the app that were not already sent for notifications created over the past 7 days and for which the user is the recipient of the notification.

When a courtesy message is received, the user can access the reserved area, after selecting the message and providing consent for the opening and completion of the notification, where the electronic elements subject of the notification can be found, consulted and acquired. It is also possible to make the payment for the notification.
