# Creation of a delegation

Pressing the “Add a delegation” button, the user creates a new delegation.

The mandatory fields that the user specifies are: indication if they want to delegate a physical person/legal person, first and last name or company name of the delegate, fiscal code of the delegate, the validity end date.  The user can also specify a sending PA to associate with the delegation. The validity start date is always set automatically to 120 days prior to the date of creation.

NP generates an acceptance code that the delegator has to provide, using their own instruments, to the delegate to complete the acceptance.\\
