# Display of the delegations

The user views the delegations that are active or being accepted by selecting “Delegations”.

The page that appears shows, in two separate tables, the delegations created by the user as a delegator and the delegations accepted as a delegate.

The following is shown for delegations created by the user: the name of the delegate, the validity start and end dates, an associated PA if applicable and the status of the delegation.
