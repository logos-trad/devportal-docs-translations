# Access to documents related to a notification

The details of the specific notifications lists the documents attached to the notification: the document subject of the notification and, if provided, the pagoPA payment notice and the F24 form to use for the payment.

Each element contains a link to use to download the document.

NP keeps the documents provided by the PA for 120 days, starting from the date of completion, after which the links to them will no longer be available.
