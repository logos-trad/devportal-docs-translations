# Details of a notification for the recipient and/or their delegate

Selecting a specific notification on the page displaying the notifications sent by the PA displays its details.

The page shows the information displayed previously, with the addition of the first and last name of the recipient(s) and the information related to the methods and status of the payment, if present.

ATTENTION: Notification Platform stores the moment in which the user views the details of the notification for the first time as the moment the notification is completed for the recipient, if completion did not happen previously due to another event (e.g. lapsing of the time limits).

This event generates a certificate enforceable against third parties.\\
