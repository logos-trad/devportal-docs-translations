# Display of notifications for the recipient

Selecting “Notifications” displays the page displaying the notifications sent to the user.

The display shows the notifications, starting from the most recent one, in table form, with information regarding the date the notification was sent, the sending PA, subject of the notification, IUN and notification status.

The user can set filters to reduce the number of notifications displayed by setting a display time interval, or by setting a specific IUN.

The user can also select the size of the page to display 10, 20 or 50 elements.
