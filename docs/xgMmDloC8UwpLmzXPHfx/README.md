# Introduction

The information exchange between the provider and user takes place outside of the perimeter of the technical infrastructure of PDND Interoperability, which is not visible. Once PDND Interoperability has issued a valid voucher to the user, they can directly contact the provider. The tracing service makes it possible to collect quantitative information retarding these transactions.

As defined in the guidelines for interoperability in paragraph 13, "Collection of information regarding accesses and transactions", tracing is

> a service that collects the traces that describe exclusively the quantitative trend of the transactions that take place between each provider and each user.

### What tracing does

* It provides support for the tracing and observation of interactions between members;
* It collects information used for measuring the effectiveness of interoperability over time.

### What tracing does not do

* It does not provide support for assessing any SLAs agreed upon between members;
* It does not set automatic blocks if a certain user exceeds the threshold of API calls/day declared in the purpose.
